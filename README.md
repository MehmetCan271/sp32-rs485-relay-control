Control multiple relays using an ESP32 and RS485 communication with Modbus RTU commands. The project demonstrates how to send commands to toggle relays on and off, using a HardwareSerial interface on the ESP32. Includes example code and detailed explanations for implementing relay control via Modbus RTU.
